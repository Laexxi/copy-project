# CopyTool

This is my first ever (finished) Project. The need came from constantly having to organize and tidy up my download folder. I got the idea of making the moving of files more conveniant without having to move file by file.
CopyTool is a powerful, user-friendly tool designed for copying or moving files and folders based on user-defined criteria. The tool is ideal for organizing files efficiently, allowing users to manually or automatically assign tags to files and folders, which then determine their destination directories.
As I am developing on windows it will (should lol) work there. I chose Python because of multiplatforming possibilites but did not test this yet.

# Features

- Custom Source Directory: Select a source directory from where the files and folders will be processed.
- Manual Mode: In the manual mode, users can assign custom tags to each item (file or folder) which correspond to specific target directories.
- Multilingual Support: The tool is equipped to support multiple languages.
- Light/Dark Mode: I do not know why you would want a Light mode, but it was a nice challange

# Upcoming (not in particular order)

- Automatic Mode: The automatic mode reads the names of items and suggests target directories based on predefined tags.
- Initial Setup at First start
- see what the tool is actually doing
- Logs (with own settings, how long to save, ...)
- More Languages
- Pause and Resume
- Priority with drag and drop
- Better UI
- Report at the end
- Maybe: Copy/move to Cloud
- Maybe: Find and rename duplicates
- Maybe: Improved Tagging (Auto-Tagging by file type)
- Maybe: Automatic workflow
- Fully automated version management and package publishing

I am a new developer and have no idea what I am doing. Sadly I wont be able to review and manage (large) contributions. I might be able to use them, but maybe not.
